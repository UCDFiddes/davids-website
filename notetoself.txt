The custom 404 page doesn't work with a website hosted with GitHub Pages. I'll
have to make the decision between leaving the page unused and continuing to host
through GitHub Pages or transferring the files to a new repo/finding a way to
convert the current repo and hosting through something like Vercel/the free domains
you get from the student thing.

also, SIGN UP FOR THE STUDENT THING!!!!!!!!!

tl;dr: custom 404 page no worky github.io. change? maybe. unga bunga
